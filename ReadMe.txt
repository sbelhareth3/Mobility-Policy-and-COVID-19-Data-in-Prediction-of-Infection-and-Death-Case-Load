### What is this project? ###

Here we preprocess the data from the Apple mobility dataset, NYTimes COVID dataset, and Oxford University government policy dataset, and use the data to train three different LSTM models.

### How to install necessary packages ###

The first block of the .ipynb file contains the code necessary to install any packages that do not come with Conda by default.

### Running a demo ###

Run the .ipynb file with the Apple mobility dataset, NYTimes COVID dataset, and Oxford University government policy dataset that we link to in our documents. Change the 'lead' variable (an input to 'mainProgram()') to 7 or 14 days, depending on whether you would like to forecast ahead by 7 or 14 days.
